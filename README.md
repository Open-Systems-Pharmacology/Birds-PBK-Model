# Birds-PBK-Model

Model files and R code of the studies from the published Birds PBK model evaluation.

## Repository Files
The repository contains simulation files with the base birds structure for the different partition coefficient calculation methods. These can be paramterised in R to get the simulation files used for the publication. In order to update simulations of the birds model in MoBi, the AllCalculationMethods.pkml file needs to be replaced.

## Version Information
