This code generates the simulations plots used for the publication.

- Install R version 4.1.x (for using renv) and RStudio. 
- ( If you want to use a different R version you need to install `renv` from CRAN, run `renv::restore()`, and manually install the packages `rClr`, `ospsuite`, and `esqlabsR` from Code/packages)
- Before opening the project make sure you have installed renv from CRAN
- Open the project file Code/Code/Birds.Rproj
- Run Birds_main.R to generate the simulations and plots
